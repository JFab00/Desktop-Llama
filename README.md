  Desktop Llama is a project I did during classes in my last year of high-school.  
  I remember it was around the time when Untitled Goose Game came out... some weeks later a certain individual called Samperson created this desktop application called Desktop Goose, inspired by the UGG (I think).  
  I downloaded it, and tried it during my classes, and one of my teachers noticed it and told me how he used to do such things when he was young, so I got motivated to create something similar in order to impress my teacher... So bad Covid-19 happened and I never had a chance to show him in person...

## Features
It doesn't have too many...  
Overall is just a llama that goes from point A to point B and when it reaches the destination it starts eating grass...
The running animations I've took them from internet, while the eating grass one I made it myself.
If you really want to, you can activate the coordinates of the llama and the destination coordinates by clicking on the top-left corner menu...

## Footer
It's not really much but it was honest work... I've written the code in like 3 days during high-school classes (because we were doing stuff I already knew)
I actually remember having some trouble with it... The llama animations were to small, so when I was enlarging them they had a lot of green pixels around the llama (if I'm not wrong I've written the explanation in a comment inside the code) so I had to recreate them in higher dimensions... same happened  to the text... now it should be working fine.
